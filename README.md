# Agro-AI

## CSCI 4970 Capstone Project

This project aims to build trust among farmers in artificial intelligence by demonstrating an interactive learning system. Users will provide input to a machine learning algorithm and observe how their feedback impacts its accuracy.

## Project Overview

- **Core Functionality**: Users will interact with a web-based interface to label images of corn as either *healthy* or *unhealthy*.  
- **Machine Learning Integration**: The system employs *active learning*, meaning it refines its model based on user-provided labels.  

## Features

- **Backend**: Flask (Python)  
- **Frontend**: HTML5, JavaScript (Fetch API)  


# How to run on Mac

create venv, install requirements.txt, run runApp.py
in another terminal window,
brew install redis
brew services start redis
redis-cli ping


## Technologies Used

- Flask (for the backend server)  
- JavaScript Fetch API (for client-server communication)  
- HTML5/CSS (for UI)  
- Machine Learning (for classification)
