        <h4>Background &amp; Motivation</h4>
        <p>
          The future of food production is confronted with major challenges, 
          including a declining farming workforce, an aging population of farmers, 
          and increasing global food demand. At present, identifying blighted plants 
          is a manual and time-intensive task, which hampers farming efficiency. ​ 
        </p>
        <p>
          The Agro-AI project addresses this issue by leveraging machine learning to 
          automate the detection of plant blight. Its goal is to enhance crop yields 
          while minimizing the need for manual labor. Additionally, the project 
          showcases how artificial intelligence and machine learning can revolutionize 
          agriculture, offering meaningful insights to support farmers and industry 
          professionals.

        <h4>Architecture &amp; Tech Stack</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Frontend:</strong> Flask + Bootstrap templates</li>
          <li><strong>Backend:</strong> Flask (Python), TensorFlow/Keras</li>
          <li><strong>Storage:</strong> Redis for session &amp; cache</li>

        <h4>Development Process</h4>
        <p>
          We collaborated on GitHub, used VS Code for daily work, and followed an MVC pattern 
          in Flask.  Redis stores intermediate labels, while Keras handles training, and we 
          expose everything via simple Flask routes and Jinja2 views.
